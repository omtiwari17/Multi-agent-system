# Supplier Comparison Report: Injection Molding (ABS, India, ISO 9001, >50k/month)

## Introduction
This report provides a comparative analysis of four injection molding suppliers in India, identified based on the query for ABS material, ISO 9001 certification, and a minimum monthly capacity of 50,000 units. All shortlisted suppliers demonstrate strong capabilities in high-volume injection molding, are located in India, process ABS, and hold ISO 9001 certification, alongside other relevant industry standards.

## Overall Fit Summary
All four suppliers meet the fundamental requirements of the query. They are established manufacturers in India specializing in injection molding, with explicit mention of ABS material processing and ISO 9001 certification. Their stated machine counts (150-300+) and annual production figures (millions of parts) confirm their capability to meet or exceed the required monthly capacity of 50,000 units. The primary missing information across all suppliers is specific lead times and minimum order quantities, which are crucial for subsequent engagement.

## Conclusion
All four suppliers present strong profiles that meet the specified requirements for ABS injection molding in India, with high volume capacity and ISO 9001 certification. Roto Precision Pvt. Ltd. edged out the others slightly due to its strong evidence of high volume and comprehensive certifications. Shaily Engineering Plastics Ltd. and Vasantha Tool Crafts Pvt. Ltd. are also highly competitive, with Shaily boasting the highest machine count and Vasantha having the highest explicit annual capacity and extensive in-house services. Sansera Engineering Ltd., while a strong contender, had a slightly lower comparative capacity score and was missing a direct email contact.

The next crucial step for any of these suppliers would be to inquire about specific lead times and minimum order quantities to ensure they align with project timelines and budget constraints.
