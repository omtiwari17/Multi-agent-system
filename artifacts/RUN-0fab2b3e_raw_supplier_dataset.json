Monthly capacity was inferred based on the number of injection molding machines, their tonnage, stated operational hours (e.g., 24x7), and the industries served (e.g., automotive, consumer goods) which typically require high volume production. All identified suppliers demonstrate robust infrastructure and certifications indicating capability to meet or exceed the minimum monthly capacity of 50,000 units for typical ABS injection molded parts."
