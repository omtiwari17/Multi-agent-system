Identified multiple companies that explicitly state injection molding as a service, list ABS as a material they process, hold ISO 9001 certification, and describe infrastructure (number/tonnage of machines) that implies capacity well over 50,000 units/month. Focused on companies with clear evidence on their official websites. Capacity was inferred from the number and range of injection molding machines available, which typically allows for high volume production."
