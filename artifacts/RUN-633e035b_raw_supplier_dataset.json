    "summary": "Suppliers were identified using search queries like 'Injection Molding India ABS ISO 9001 manufacturers'. Capacity was inferred from the number and tonnage of injection molding machines or stated processing tonnage. For the monthly capacity of 50,000 units, it's assumed that a typical ABS part weighs a few grams to a few hundred grams. Facilities with multiple machines ranging from 50T to 550T (or stated tonnage processing capacity like 100-120 tons/month or 38,000 MT/year) are considered to easily exceed 50,000 units per month for most common ABS parts. For example, 100 tons/month processing capacity equates to 100,000 kg/month. If an ABS part weighs 100g (0.1kg), this facility can produce 1,000,000 units per month. All listed suppliers clearly indicate the ability to handle ABS material and hold ISO 9001 certification."
